# Styleguide

Within Augment Vision we are using various programming languages, however for our back-end, server-side components, we mainly focus on the Go language created by Google due to various reason; please refer to external documentation to have a better understanding.

- Angular (@KilianBoute)

With this styleguide we aim to develop a uniform codebase with similar pratices so one developer can move from one codebase to the other, feeling familiar with the same code style and best practices.
